## Technical Background

I began my coding journey during junior year of highschool where I was taught Visual Basic. I then moved on to Java, CSS, and HTML in AP Computer Science and web design during my senior year and started enjoying seeing my progress. Once I came to college I unfortunately had to relearn Java instead of learning python my first year. I then moved on to more complex lanauages like linux and C when sophomore year came around and started dreading coding as it didn't feel fun anymore but I am eager to work with Gscript in Godot because it has brought back my interest in programming.
